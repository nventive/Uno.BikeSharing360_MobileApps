# Uno Port of the BikeSharing 360 Apps for Xamarin Forms over Uno

This is the [Uno Platform-based](http://platform.uno) port of 
the [Bike Sharing 360 App](https://github.com/Microsoft/BikeSharing360_MobileApps), using the [Uno.Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/nventive/Uno.Xamarin.Forms)
port to allow for [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms) to run in a WebAssembly environment.

The [BikeSharing.Xamarin-UWP](BikeSharing.Xamarin-UWP.sln) solution contains heads for iOS, Android and WebAssembly platforms.

# BikeSharing360

During our Connect(); event this year we presented 15 demos in Scott Guthrie’s and Scott Hanselman’s keynotes. If you missed the keynotes, you can watch the recording in [Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2016/Keynotes-Scott-Guthrie-and-Scott-Hanselman).

This year, we built the technology stack for a fictional company named BikeSharing360, which allows users to rent bikes from one location to another.

BikeSharing360 is a fictitious example of a smart bike sharing system with 10,000 bikes distributed in 650 stations located throughout New York City and Seattle. Their vision is to provide a modern and personalized experience to riders and to run their business with intelligence.

In this demo scenario, we built several apps for both the enterprise and the consumer (bike riders). You can find all other BikeSharing360 repos in the following locations:

* [Mobile Apps](https://github.com/Microsoft/BikeSharing360_MobileApps)
* [Backend Services](https://github.com/Microsoft/BikeSharing360_BackendServices)
* [Websites](https://github.com/Microsoft/BikeSharing360_Websites)
* [Single Container Apps](https://github.com/Microsoft/BikeSharing360_SingleContainer)
* [Multi Container Apps](https://github.com/Microsoft/BikeSharing360_MultiContainer)
* [Cognitive Services Kiosk App](https://github.com/Microsoft/BikeSharing360_CognitiveServicesKioskApp)
* [Azure Bot App](https://github.com/Microsoft/BikeSharing360_BotApps)

## BikeRider Xamarin app and Maintenance Cordova app
This repository contains the BikeRider consumer-facing mobile apps for renting bikes and the BikeSharing360 maintenance app built with Cordova.

**Note:** This document is about the **Xamarin apps**. For the [Cordova app click here](./Cordova.md).

### Supported Platforms: iOS, Android, and Windows
The BikeRider app is available for three platforms:

* iOS (including a watchOS app)
* Android
* Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

BikeRider features **93.7% code share** across all platforms (7.34% iOS / 8.61% Android / 2.72% Windows).

## Xamarin.Forms App (BikeRider)

[Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms) allows you to build native UIs for iOS, Android, and Windows from a single, shared codebase. You can dive into mobile development with Xamarin.Forms by following our [free self-guided learning](https://university.xamarin.com/classes/track/self-guided) from Xamarin University. This project exercises the following patterns and features:

* [XAML UI](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/)
